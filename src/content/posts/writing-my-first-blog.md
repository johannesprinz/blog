## Why

I've been wanting to do this for such a long time. Recently I have had the synchronicity of multiple sources[^Podcasts] reminding me to "Just get started" and the importance for documenting your own path using blogs or journaling.

## What

> As an **engineer**
I would like to **share my learnings** with my **future self**
So that I can **reflect** on my journey **and improve** my workflow for the next journey.

It needs to be public www.johannesprinz.com to force a certain level of quality by social pressure.

## How

## If I where to do it again

## Todo list

- [x] Choose a blog engine
- [x] Learn more about blog engine
- [x] Find a theme that supports syntax highlighting
- [ ] Hosting
  - [x] Explore hosting using Azure blob storage
    Turns out Microsoft (MS) has simplified this into a static site hosting service
  - [x] Explore hosting using Static site hosting
  - [x] Explore hosting github pages
  - [ ] Configure DNS to point to hosted site
- [ ] Refine branching publishing workflow

## What I learned

- [Hugo](todo)
- [git submodules](todo)
- [GitHub Pages](todo) When using Github pages with Hugo you need to match the repo name with the github pages url for them to work nicely together.
- [GitHub Actions](todo)
- [Azure static website service](todo) When using with Hugo you need to ensure the Hugo instance is in the root of your repo for the build action to work. In this case I chose not to build, just publish since I do this manually to control the publishing workflow. This is a reminance of playing with GitHub pages spike.
